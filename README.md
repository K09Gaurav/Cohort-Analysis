# Conclusion
In conclusion, our analysis reveals notable fluctuations in both customer retention and store sales over the years 2010 and 2011. While the retention rate initially decreased in 2010, it showed signs of improvement in 2011. However, our findings also highlight a significant decline in store sales during December 2011 compared to the previous year. These observations underscore the importance of further investigation into the underlying factors influencing these trends. With additional data and analysis, we can gain deeper insights into the reasons behind these fluctuations and formulate strategies to enhance customer retention and stabilize sales performance, particularly during seasonal peaks and troughs. By addressing these issues, we can position our business for sustainable growth and success in the future.
